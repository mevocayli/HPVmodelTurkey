Dynamic compartmental epidemic model for HPV in Turkish Population 


## Summary


Dynamic compartmental model is developed in order to evaluate transmission of HPV 16/18 in the in the Turkish population. Compartmental model is described 
as non-linear system of coupled differential equations. The population has been divided into 3 sexual activity groups (s = 1,2,3) and 4 age groups 
(a=1,2,3,4) so that system of differential equations has been formed as 12 different sub-groups for each stage of disease progression. The course of the 
diseases which are caused by HPV 16/18 described as 14 stages for women and 5 stages for men. The poor course of the disease in women was studied as 
susceptible, infected, low-grade pre-cancerous stage, high grade pre-cancerous stage, and cancer also infected and pre-cancerous stages are divided into 2 
groups in order to evaluate the differences between two genotypes HPV 16 and HPV 18. Furthermore, recovered stages (RI, RL, RH, RC) for women has 
designated for the amount of people has been screened with the help of the Turkish national screening program. However poor course of the disease in men 
designated as inconsequential and only susceptible, infected and naturally immune stages has been formed for the course of the disease in men by the way 
infected and immune stages also divided into 2 groups for two genotypes. After, the population is divided into 3 sexual activity groups, 4 age groups and 
determined stages of the progression is divided into 2 genotype groups, the system of differential equations simulated for each time point t and for 152 
dimensions which are the subgroups determined by age, sexual activity and genotype of the HPV. Only the infection coefficient brings the non-linear feature 
to the system because multiplication of the terms which are number of the people in the susceptible stage and number of the people in the infected stages 
for each gender and genotypes.
